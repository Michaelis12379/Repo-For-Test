You are writing a D&D game. For this assignment, write a program using good OOP practices in the language of your choice that implements the following: 






Two players that start with 100 hit points, and 10 gold pieces each.






One player is a Dwarf with an axe doing 1 - 4 damage.






One player is a Wizard having one spell doing 1-8 damage.










Move each round - there doesn’t have to be any “real” move. Your program can just say, “player x moved.” - this is a “round.”






Each round has a 50% chance of an encounter.






The type of encounters are equally likely and include:






Fight a monster. You define any 6 monsters with at least 3 levels of hierarchy.  Fighting is simple - there is only one melee round and the monster attacks the player one time and inflicts a certain amount of damage using a certain type of attack. i.e., one monster might attack with a sword and do 1-6 damage, another with an axe and 1-4 damage and another with a spell 1-6 damage. The player then attacks  one time.  






A treasure chest is found with a certain number of gold pieces. 






A treasure chest is found with a potion which restores a random amount of hit points.










If there is no encounter, add one to the health of the player (i.e., they are recuperating and resting)






For each round, update all the player stats, which should include:






Hitpoints






Gold pieces






Number of monsters beaten






Number of turns alive
